      &4 Foreword: Dear reader this book
      is intended to pass on my knowledge.
      Feeling the need to discover the
      arts of reanimation, I do not suggest
      to perform these experiments.

      Warnings:
      Do not stand too close to the experiment
      as electricity is known to arc.
      The experiments are hungry, care should
      be taken to ensure extra materials do
      not come into contact

      to my experiment which caused my
      knowledge to decrease.
      PLEASE REMEMBER THE EXTRA INGREDIENTS.
