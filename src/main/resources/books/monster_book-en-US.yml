      Foreword: If you have read my previous books,
      you should know the standard procedures and
      safety precautions. I would like to say from
      this point onwards... These summons can
      cause death and containment of these mobs
      is recommended

      For higher tier summons, you'll need to
      unlock my third book of 4:
      The effects of Five billion Volts on various
      cadavers - THE NETHER MOBS GUIDE
      To get my next book, you'll need to repeat
      how you got This book, but instead of a bone,
      you'll need a blaze rod.
