      Foreword: If you have read my previous books,
      you should know the standard procedures and
      safety precautions. I would like to say from
      this point onwards... These summons can cause
      death and containment of these mobs is
      recommended

      For higher tier summons, you'll need to unlock
      my last book: The effects of Five billion Volts
      on various cadavers - THE END MOBS GUIDE
      To get my next book, you'll need to repeat how
      you got his book, but instead of a blaze rod,
      you'll need an end rod.
